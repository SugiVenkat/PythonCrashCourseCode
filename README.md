# PythonCrashCourseCode
It is a long file with the Python concepts breifly explained with code snippets and comments. 
Start with commenting the whole file and uncomment as you go through the file, step by step.
I have compiled python concepts roughly in following order: 
print statements, 
variables, 
Explicit typecasting, 
end and sep in print, 
input statement with int, float and eval casting, 
Formatting strings, 
Arithmetic operators
Relational and logical operators
control statements using if and while, 
for loop, 
break, 
modules and functions, 
functions, args, kwargs, 
lambda, 
generators, 
wrapper, 
string as an object, 
list as an object, 
Exception handling
Class, static method, class method, dunder functions.
